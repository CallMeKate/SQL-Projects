--I'll start with a general query to get a feel for the info contained in the database and see how it is visually represented.  

SELECT * 
FROM fortune_companies




--Now I'm going to find out how many companies in the database offer healthcare benefits. 

SELECT SUM(healthcare_benefits),
CASE WHEN healthcare_benefits IS 0 THEN 'False' ELSE 'True' END
FROM fortune_companies

--Out of 43 companies, 30 offer healthcare benefits. Not too bad. If it had less than 10 , it probably wouldn't be worth it to comb through the list for potential jobs with those companies. 




--I like that quite a few of these companies offer healthcare benefits. I wonder which companies and industries offer paid time off and who has the most paid time off days. I'm also curious who is offering maternity leave and for how long.

SELECT company_name, industry, maternity_leave_weeks, paid_time_off_days
FROM fortune_companies
WHERE paid_time_off_days >= "20" 
AND maternity_leave_weeks >= "14"

--NICE!!! It looks like Technology is the way to go if you're looking for higher PTO and maternity leave.  




--I'd like to see all the info I've queried in one place. That way I can really hone in on the company(ies) in which I'd like to apply. 

SELECT company_name, maternity_leave_weeks, paid_time_off_days, ROUND(avg_employee_tenure) AS retention_years,
CASE WHEN healthcare_benefits IS 0 THEN 'False' ELSE 'True' END
FROM fortune_companies
GROUP BY avg_employee_tenure
HAVING maternity_leave_weeks >= '14' AND paid_time_off_days >= '20' 

--Awesome! Looks like I'm heading over to Indeed to see if there's any openings for me!







--I'm liking what I'm seeing so far but I want to take a look at retention. High turnover makes me kind of nervous. Let's see who's hanging on to their people.

SELECT company_name, maternity_leave_weeks, paid_time_off_days, ROUND(avg_employee_tenure) AS retention_years 
FROM fortune_companies
GROUP BY avg_employee_tenure
HAVING maternity_leave_weeks >= '14' AND paid_time_off_days >= '20' 

--So it looks like we've got some fairly stable companies here. Retention is pretty good and so are some of the benefits.
